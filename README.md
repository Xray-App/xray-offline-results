# Report testing results offline using Excel/CSV

This script provides the ability to easily report tests in offline, whenever you go the field and don't have internet/Jira access.

More info on this [blog post](https://www.getxray.app/blog/testing-in-offline-mode-using-xray-and-excel/).

You would need to:
* generate/export an Excel for the tests you aim to execute. You can use [this template](https://store.xporter.xpand-it.com/view/72?platf=JIRA8&cats=1) for the buit-in Document Generator ("docgen") or Xporter
* report the results on the Excel file
* export it to CSV
* use this Ruby-based script to submit results back to the Xray/Jira instance
